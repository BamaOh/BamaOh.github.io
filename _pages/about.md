Welcome to my blog. I am Seong Min. I graduated from University of Wisconsin - Madison with computer science and mathematics degree. I am still learning programming(Python, C++, Java) and this blog will log the learning journey.


# About this site
I created this blog to log my codes which I beileve ultimately help me learn more and better. I hope you learn from my logs(thought process) and even from my mistakes.
